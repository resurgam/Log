I have fully completed all our extracts. Everything is in the "complete" folder, categorized by name. The "TranscribedTexts" folder merely contains back-up copies of the extract images themselves, along with my transcriptions of each. Also in the "complete" folder is the index.html and image files for the homepage of my site.

You can view the functionally complete site live online at: http://web.uvic.ca/~dcarlton/extracts/complete/longernowsite/
