I have more-or-less fully completed all our extracts. The 18 "complete" ones are contained in the "complete" folder. The "TranscribedTexts" folder merely contains back-up copies of the extract images themselves, along with my transcriptions of each. All the files need to have my new "whitespace" fix applied, so they're still unjustified on the right side.

You can view the current working extracts live online at: http://web.uvic.ca/~dcarlton/extracts/complete/
