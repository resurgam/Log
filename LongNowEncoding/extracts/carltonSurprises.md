##Problems and Surprises

1. Despite what technique I try to implement, I can't render blank space using XML or CSS. If I am to justify the lines as they appear in the book, I will need to fix this.

2. I was surprised how easy it was to find a font that approximated the book-font used in the images.

3. to that end, I was equally as surprised to discover that said font renders a bit differently depending on 

the browser/medium in which it is being used. Thus, while my .doc transcriptions look nearly perfect (except for the lower-case "w"s), my XML files are not quite as aesthetically accurate.
