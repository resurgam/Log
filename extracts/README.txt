I have more-or-less fully completed 9 of our 18 extracts. The 9 most complete ones are contained in the "complete" folder, while the remainder can be found in the "stage1b" folder. The "TranscribedTexts" folder merely contains back-up copies of the extract images themselves, along with my transcriptions of each.

You can view the current working extracts live online at: http://web.uvic.ca/~dcarlton/extracts/complete/
