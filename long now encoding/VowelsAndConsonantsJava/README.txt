This tiny little program will take a line of text and spit out the number of consonants (lower case, upper case and total), the number of vowels (lower, upper and total), as well as any extra character/white space. 
Special thanks to various online ascii tables, and numerous Java tuturials online (especially http://www.javaclass.info/), because my Java is terrible. 

NOTE: You need the Java SDK/RE installed to use this file, or just run it via my Programr account from "Prog.html" (you'll need an active internet connection, though).
