1. I finished marking up the last 9 excerpts, effectively finishing the base portion of my project.

2. I finally discovered a fix for my white-space issues, using a tag in css. This hasn't been applied yet, but I 

will do that within the week, and upload the results. There will be challenges with some of my other "fixes" such 

as the lb tag, but I'm sure that will all work out. I will need to fix font size, too.  

More soon.
