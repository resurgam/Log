# Log February 3 2013

After meeting with my group on Thursday, I have done the following:

1. I researched and tested typefaces for the various fonts represented throughout the extracts, and have at least settled upon a *kind* of typeface. As far as I can tell, the main text is an old-style, serif font, while the italics are definitely an old-style font, particularly reminiscent of some sort of *Aldus*. I have downloaded a number of fonts, and will be testing them tonight

2. I manually transcribed the "aeolus" text extract as a test, and made my best attempt at preserving line-spacing and overall layout. I turned out quite well, even though some of the letters don't line up. I think I succesfully preserved the flavour of the original.

I will be uploading my transcriptions of the extracts once I have 4 more done.
