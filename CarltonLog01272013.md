1.) I researched potential technologies to use for my exhibit piece. I'm leaning toward 

using CSS to express my xml, simply because it's the most familiar method for me, and 

will likely be less of a hastle at my level.

2.) I read up considerably on DH theory, and various associated methodologies. I've 

decided that I want to represent my text extracts as closely as possible to their 

originals, and will attempt to mimic font, style and margins in my CSS.

3.) Started editing a schema to use for my project. I won't be using linguistic or 

poetic tags, but I will be marking-up sentence structure, paragraph breaks, nouns, 

verbs, etc., and vowel density. Tags like *vowel density* will provide an abstract 

representation of the aesthetic appearance and "sound" of the text, and are thus 

important for my goal of representing the __whole__ text on a more quantitative level. 

I still haven't decided on the exact tags I'm going to use, however, and likely won't 

until tomorrow. 

4.) I started looking at the calendar and mapping out when things ought to get done by. 

Defining the schema, though potentially more difficult, will likely be a less time 

intensive pursuit than encoding each extract and rendering it in CSS. I will have to 

plan accordingly.

5) Throughout all this I've been working on my -needs.md file, in the hopes that my 

research might shape itself into something pragmatically useful. So far so good.
